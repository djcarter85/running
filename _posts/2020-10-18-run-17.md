I did it!

I needed 6.66km from this final run, and so I planned out a 7km route (just in case my watch disagreed). I took it at a nice comfortable pace and barely looked at my watch, and I even sped up at the end once I knew I'd made it!

I've really enjoyed this month of running -- it's had the right mix of being challenging but achievable. The main thing I've learnt is that I actually just really enjoy running. Sometimes it's hard to motivate myself to get out there, especially as winter sets in, and so it'll be important to remember how much I enjoy it when I'm debating whether or not to go for a run.

I'm going to ease off my mileage for a while (my legs need a break!) but I'm definitely going to keep running regularly. I often decide on my runs on an ad-hoc basis, which invariably leads to fewer runs, so perhaps I should try planning my runs like I've been doing, as a way of making it an important part of my week.

I'd like to set myself another challenge at some point, but I'm going to wait for a while before deciding what it's going to be. Only time will tell if I decide to use this blog as a way of documenting my next challenge, but I've certainly found this blog a helpful way of keeping going. Knowing there will be a permanent record is a good method of motivation!

Thanks to those who have been reading this blog (yes, both of you!) for coming along with me. üòÉ
