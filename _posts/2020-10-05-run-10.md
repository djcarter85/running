![A map from Fitbit of my run](/assets/images/2020-10-05/fitbit-map.png)
As suggested on Saturday, I decided to wait an extra day before running again. Sunday's weather was utterly miserable, and between [church](https://youtu.be/IPoyJDeZpSc?t=602), [watching football](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/54313273) and dinner with friends (slow-cooked gammon ðŸ˜‹), there were enough excuses not to go out!

Another lunchtime run today; I'd planned to run before work but, as is sometimes the way, the call of the duvet was too strong when the alarm went off!

Legs felt heavy today; I think I'm starting to feel the effects of all the miles in my legs at this point. A good reminder not to run too fast but to just keep going, whatever pace I end up managing.
