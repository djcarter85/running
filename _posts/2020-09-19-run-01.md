![A map from Fitbit of my run](/assets/images/2020-09-19/fitbit-map.png)

My running challenge began on a warm September lunchtime. After a lie-in and a slow morning, I headed out around 11.45, and after a short walk to warm up I started my watch and got underway.

When I was training for a 10km race about a year ago I found a nice route creating a circuit around town, and so today I used a modification of that which worked out at just over 8km. I'm already 8% of the way through!

I took water with me, but with the temperature at around 20Â°C I think I would have been better off waiting until the evening! Lesson learnt.

This is going to be a challenge, but a manageable one I think. I'm looking forward to continuing!
