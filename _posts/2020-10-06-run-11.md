After a lethargic run yesterday, today's run was glorious! I even managed to do the final kilometre in less than 5 minutes. Just goes to show that you can never quite tell how good a run will be before you get out there.

It's time for another podcast recommendation.

[Tim Hein](https://twitter.com/Tim_Hein) and [Brady Haran](https://twitter.com/BradyHaran) are two friends who wanted to start a podcast, but had too many ideas for what it should be about to pick just one. So each week on [The Unmade Podcast](https://www.unmade.fm/) they discuss "ideas for podcasts that they will never make". I often find myself laughing out loud at the banter between these two great friends, even if by episode 60 (which I listened to today) most of the ideas simply stem from a topic that one of them wants to discuss.

If you want a podcast that doesn't require too much brain power (great for a run!) and makes you laugh, The Unmade Podcast is definitely worth a listen.
