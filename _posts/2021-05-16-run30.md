Welcome back!

After finishing <em>Run 100</em>, I did indeed carry on running but didn't set myself another challenge. As the winter set in I got out of the habit of running, and then unfortunately around Christmas I managed to injure my back, so in the first few months of the year I didn't run very much.

Now that my back is (mostly) better, I want to get back into running, but unfortunately I'm lacking fitness. So I've set myself a new challenge to <strong>run 30km in a month</strong>; I'm calling it <em>Run 30</em>. Obviously, this is a lot less than the 100km I did last year, but this is a good opportunity for me to learn that I can enjoy running however high or low my performance levels are.

See you in a month ...
