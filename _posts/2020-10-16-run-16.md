![A map from Fitbit of my run](/assets/images/2020-10-16/fitbit-map.png)
Another lunchtime run today, as I was helping out with the church youth group after work. For that reason I did 4 laps of my new route (instead of 5) to fit within my lunch break, leaving a very manageable 6.66km for the weekend.

A very similar run to Wednesday, which you can see by looking at the map of my run. It does make me question why I include them in every post -- although the answer is pretty clear: I always forget to take an interesting photo!

I have one more run to go. I'm visiting family tomorrow, so it'll be at some point on Sunday, possibly late morning between church and lunch. I'm nearly there!
