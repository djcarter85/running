![A map from Fitbit of my run](/assets/images/2020-10-01/fitbit-map.png)
For a while I've been struggling to find a nice flat 5K route without too many road crossings or sharp turns.

The other day I had a brainwave - why couldn't I just find a flat stretch and run up and down it? So that's what I did today: a quiet, flat segment of pavement of about 0.6km, there and back 5 times. Other than having to slow and turn at each end, it was easy to keep up a consistent pace (my splits were all pretty close to 5min/km), and it was fun being able to tick of the sections in my head as the run carried on.

It would be nice to find a variation with a loop at either end, so I'm not just stopping dead; I think I might need to spend some time on [On The Go Map](https://onthegomap.com/) to find a route matching that description!
