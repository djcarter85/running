![A map from Fitbit of my run](/assets/images/2020-09-29/fitbit-map.png)
Another very enjoyable run.

Didn't quite "feel like it" when I went out, after a day of work and it being a little on the cold side, but once I got going it was fine. A note to come back to when it's cold and wet in a couple of months' time! I deliberately started out slow and it transformed into quite a comfortable pace. There's something quite comforting about the monotony of putting one foot in front of the other for half an hour.
